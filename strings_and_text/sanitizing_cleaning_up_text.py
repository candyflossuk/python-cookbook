"""
This script gives some guidance on sanitizing and cleaning up
text entered by users.

You may want to use:
str.upper() and str.lower() to convert to a standard case
str.replace() or re.sub() to remove very specific character sequences
unicodedata.normalize() to normalize text

The code below shows how to go one step further in the sanitization process,
to eliminate ranges of characters or strip diacritical marks.
This can be done by using str.translate()
"""
import unicodedata
import sys

s = 'pýtĥöñ\fis\tawesome\r\n'

# clean up the whitespace, \t and \f are spaces and \r carriage return
remap = {
    ord('\t'): ' ',
    ord('\f'): ' ',
    ord('\r'): None,  # deleted
}
a = s.translate(remap)  # 'pýtĥöñ is awesome\n'

# mappings can be much larger - such as removing all combining characters
cmb_chrs = dict.fromkeys(c for c in range(sys.maxunicode)
                         if unicodedata.combining(chr(c)))
b = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', a)
# 'pýtĥöñ is awesome\n'
b.translate(cmb_chrs)
# 'python is awesome\n'

"""
In the example above - a dictionary mapping every unicode combining 
character is mapped to None using dict.fromkeys()

Input is normalized into decomposed from - then translated 
to delete all the accents.

The example below uses a translation table that maps all unicode
decimal digit characters to equivalent in ASCII
"""
digitmap = { c: ord('0') + unicodedata.digit(chr(c))
             for c in range(sys.maxunicode)
             if unicodedata.category(chr(c)) == 'Nd'}
len(digitmap)
# Arabic
x = '\u0661\u0662\u0663'
x.translate(digitmap)
# '123'

"""
Another method of doing cleaning up of text involves I/O decoding and encoding functions.
First do preliminary cleanup of text - then run it through combination 
of encode() or decode() operations to strip and alter it.
"""
a
b = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', a)
b.encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('ascii')
# 'python is awesome\n'

"""
Normalization process decomposes the original text into
characters along with the separate combining characters. 

The subsequent ASCII encoding decoding discards all characters 
in one go. 

Sanitizing text can have an impact on run time performance. 
The simpler it is - the quicker it is
str.replace is often quickest - even when called multiple times

Cleaning up white space for example is quickest using...
"""

def clean_spaces(s):
    s = s.replace('\r', '')
    s = s.replace('\t', ' ')
    s = s.replace('\f', ' ')
    return s

# This is quicker than using translate() or an approach using regex

# Translate however is fast if you need to perform nontrivial char-> char mapping or deletion
